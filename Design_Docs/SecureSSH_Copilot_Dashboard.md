```

### 1. Left Sidebar: Connections & Sessions

- **Saved Connections**: A collapsible list of known hosts.
- **New Connection**: A clear button or link to quickly add a new SSH profile.
- **Active Sessions**: A list or tree structure showing all open sessions. Selecting one switches the main content area to that session’s terminal.
- **Settings/Preferences**: A quick shortcut for app-wide configuration, including encryption, theme, and LLM settings.

### 2. Main Content Area

- **Tabbed or Split-Terminal Interface**:
    - Each tab corresponds to a connected session.
    - Optionally allow splitting the main window to display multiple terminals simultaneously (horizontal/vertical splits).
- **Terminal Emulator**:
    - Full-featured terminal with typical SSH features (scrollback, color support, copy/paste).
    - Real-time feed into the LLM for contextual suggestions.

### 3. Right Panel: LLM Copilot & Chat

- **Chat/Conversation Window**:
    - Users can type questions, get clarifications, or ask for specific troubleshooting steps related to the active session.
- **Command Recommendations**:
    - Contextually surfaced commands or short scripts the LLM suggests based on recent terminal output or user queries.
    - “Review & Execute” feature to let the user confirm/edit a suggestion before sending it to the terminal.
- **LLM Privacy Controls**:
    - Toggle for enabling/disabling or limiting what data is shared with the local model.
- **LLM Status**:
    - Indicate whether the LLM is running or paused.

### 4. Bottom Bar / Status Area

- **Connection Status**: Hostname, IP, and a connect/disconnect indicator.
- **System Resources**: Quick glance at CPU/RAM usage (especially useful if running a local LLM).
- **Encryption Indicator**: Shows if logs and session data are encrypted.
- **Log File Status**: Shows where logs are being written and if they are password protected.
- **Session Timer** (optional): Helps with time tracking and automated documentation.

## Layout Rationale

1. **Separation of Concerns**:
    - **Left Sidebar** focuses on session management (creating, switching, disconnecting).
    - **Main Content** is dedicated to the terminal experience.
    - **Right Panel** is all about LLM interactions, ensuring the AI advice is always visible and non-intrusive.
2. **Windows-Friendly**:
    - A typical “sidebar + main + right panel” layout is familiar to Windows users.
    - Menus at the top mirror standard Windows app design patterns.
3. **Ease of Use**:
    - Tabs for multiple sessions are a common paradigm (e.g., modern browsers, IDEs).
    - Splitting the main terminal window is an advanced feature for power users.
4. **Privacy & Security Indicators**:
    - Keeping encryption and LLM status in sight gives users peace of mind that data is secure.
5. **Extensibility**:
    - Additional panels or expansions (e.g., a bottom console for logs, a plugin panel) can be integrated without disrupting the core layout.

**Note**: The layout above is a high-level concept. When implementing in a framework like PyQt or Electron.js, you’ll design each panel or widget specifically. Elements such as drag-and-drop tabs, resizable splits, and dynamic reveal/hide of the side panels are recommended to improve usability.
