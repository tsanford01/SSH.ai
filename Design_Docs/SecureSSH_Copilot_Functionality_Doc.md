## 3. Terminal Emulation & Sessions

**Location in UI**:

- **Main Dashboard** (Center - Tabbed or Split Terminal)

### 3.1 Open/Close Sessions

- **Function**: Initiate an SSH session to a remote host and manage multiple simultaneous connections.
- **Flow**:
    1. User selects an existing connection profile or manually enters credentials.
    2. A new tab (or split window) is created in the Main Dashboard.
    3. Connection status is shown (connected, disconnected, reconnecting).
    4. User can close a tab to terminate the SSH session.

### 3.2 Terminal Features

### 4.1 Local Model Hosting

- **Function**: Runs a locally hosted Large Language Model (Llama, GPT-J, etc.) to process queries offline.
- **Behavior**:
    - The model is loaded during application startup or on-demand when user activates the AI features.
    - If resources are insufficient, user is prompted to switch to a smaller model or disable LLM.

### 4.2 Chat Interface

- **Function**: A text-based conversation window where the user can ask questions about the session or command outputs.
- **Flow**:
    1. User types a query in the chat input field (e.g., “Why did this command fail?”).
    2. The LLM processes recent terminal output + user question.
    3. The LLM returns an answer or suggestion.
    4. Chat is saved as conversation history for the current session.

### 4.3 Contextual Session Parsing

- **Function**: LLM automatically receives relevant snippets from terminal output.
- **Behavior**:
    - The application screens the last X lines or relevant log segments and feeds them to the model.
    - Sensitive info (e.g., passwords) is either redacted or not captured if “Limit LLM Data” is on.

### 4.4 Privacy Controls

- **Function**: Enable/disable or limit the LLM’s access to session data.
- **Behavior**:
    - User can fully disable the LLM if they want zero AI interaction.

## 5. Command Recommendations

**Location in UI**:

- **Main Dashboard** (Right Panel > Recommendations)
- **LLM Chat / Command Recommendations Page** (Right Panel)

### 5.1 Real-Time Suggestions

- **Function**: The LLM identifies potential commands the user might need based on session context or error messages.
- **Flow**:
    1. Terminal output is parsed continuously.
    2. If the LLM detects an error or a known pattern (“Package not found”), it suggests a command.
    3. Suggestions appear in a small list with short descriptions (e.g., “Try installing package XYZ”).

### 5.2 Review & Execute

- **Function**: Users can preview AI-generated commands before running them.
- **Flow**:
    1. A suggested command (e.g., “apt-get install missing_pkg”) is displayed.
    2. User clicks “Review & Execute.”
    3. A pop-up or inline editor allows the user to modify the command.
    4. User confirms execution, and the command is sent to the terminal.

### 5.3 Safety / Destructive Action Warnings

- **Function**: Provide explicit warnings for risky commands (e.g., “rm -rf /,” “iptables flush,” etc.).
- **Behavior**:
    - If a suggested command is flagged as potentially destructive, the system requires an extra confirmation prompt.
    - The user must type “YES” or similar to proceed.

    - When a session ends (user closes it), the system compiles a summary.
    - Summaries can be displayed in Markdown or plain text.
    - Key insights or solutions are highlighted with short LLM commentary if available.

### 6.2 Log Encryption

- **Function**: Ensures session data is encrypted at rest to maintain privacy.
- **Behavior**:
    - Summaries and logs are stored locally with AES-256 or user-defined encryption keys.
    - If encryption is disabled, logs remain in plaintext or are not saved at all.

### 6.3 Export & Sharing

- **Function**: Allows user to export a session log or summary for documentation or auditing.
- **Flow**:
    1. User visits “Session Summaries” page.
    2. Selects a session log and clicks “Export.”
    3. Choose format (Markdown, HTML, PDF).
    4. (Optional) Password-protect or encrypt the exported file.

### 6.4 Log Retention Policies

- **Function**: Control how many days or how many logs to keep.
- **Behavior**:
    - User sets a retention period in **Settings** (e.g., 30 days).
